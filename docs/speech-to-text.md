# Setting up Speech to Text Demo

`cd` into `src/main/js`.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

You should see a new icon in the toolbar. Click it and a small window will open. Use the keyboard shortcut for Chrome developer tools to open up the console. You'll need to type in the following command to enter the API key before using it:

```javascript
window.WITAI_API_SECRET = "Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
```

Ask for the API key or get a free one from wit.ai.
